<p>The Adhearsion team offers consulting services for two classes of business needs:

<ul>
  <li>Companies wanting custom, integrated, and effective communication solutions.</li>
  <li>New telephony-based tech startups</li>
</ul>

<p>The communication technology industry is rapidly evolving and it's our job to stay on top of it. Using our expertise will help you develop the most effective, customized solution for your specific business needs.</p>
  
<p>If you have an existing system, regardless of vendor, we can help you improve it. If you ground-up overhaul of the technologies that help you communicate, we'll work with you to tailor a system with the right balance of simplicity and features.</p>
